HOW TO COMPILE dmcDue/iDmc
--------------------------

Starting from the 2.x.x series, iDmc is a pure Java program.

iDmc was developed under Debian GNU/Linux mainly using the IBM Eclipse
IDE (www.eclipse.org).

The Java part is Java2 1.5 compliant.

Full and successful compile and runtime testing was done with Sun's Java2 
SDK/JRE 1.5.0_06 under Ubuntu GNU/Linux (x86_64) and under Micro$oft Windows XP.

The compilation defaults to produce a "static" jar file.
This is to avoid dependencies hells only and is not stricly
required.

Sofware you need to compile:

- Java2 SDK 1.4 o superiore
  java.sun.com/j2se/

- Apace ant 1.5 or above
  http://ant.apache.org/

Third part libraries:

- idmclib: The iDMC C support library

- JGoodies Forms, Java panels layout library
  http://www.jgoodies.com/

- JFree JFreeChart 0.9.18: a free Java class library for generating charts
  www.jfree.org

- JCommon 0.9.3: used by JFreeChart
  www.jfree.org

- jakarta-log4j-1.2.14: logging library used by JFreeChart
  http://logging.apache.org/log4j/docs

The JGoodies Forms library API is stable so, generally
speaking, you should be able to use more recent versions of this
library. About JFreeChart, the core library of the program, stick to
the specified version or you'll certainly have to adapt part of the
code.

To compile under Linux using the included build.xml
unpack all the packages in a same directory, then use ant to compile all:

$ cd iDmc
$ ant dist-linux

look for other ant targets in the build.xml file.

If something goes wrong or you want to compile under that nasty mass
commercial operative system then you should really have a look to the
build.xml.

In the misc directory you will also find a NSIS (Nullsoft Scriptable
Install System, http://nsis.sourceforge.net/home/) script to create
Windows autoinstaller packages.
