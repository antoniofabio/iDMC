HOW TO COMPILE dmcDue/iDmc
--------------------------

Starting from the 2.x.x series, iDmc is a pure Java program
(although it depends on the native idmclib library).

iDmc was developed under Debian and Ubuntu GNU/Linux mainly using the IBM Eclipse
IDE (www.eclipse.org) and Netbeans.

The Java part is Java2 1.6 compliant.

Full and successful compile and runtime testing was done with Sun's Java2 
SDK/JRE 1.5.0_08 under Ubuntu GNU/Linux (x86_64/x86_32) and under Micro$oft Windows XP.

The compilation defaults to produce a "static" jar file.
This is to avoid dependencies hells only and is not stricly
required.

Sofware you need to compile:

- Java2 SDK 1.5 or above
  java.sun.com/j2se/

- Apace ant 1.5 or above
  http://ant.apache.org/

Third part libraries:

- idmclib: The iDMC C support library, version 0.5.0 or compatible
  http://code.google.com/p/idmclib

- JGoodies Forms, Java panels layout library
  http://www.jgoodies.com/

- JFree JFreeChart 0.9.18: a free Java class library for generating charts
  www.jfree.org

- JCommon 0.9.3: used by JFreeChart
  www.jfree.org

- jakarta-log4j-1.2.14: logging library used by JFreeChart
  http://logging.apache.org/log4j/docs

The JGoodies Forms library API is stable so, generally
speaking, you should be able to use more recent versions of this
library. About JFreeChart, the core library of the program, stick to
the specified version or you'll certainly have to adapt part of the
code.
For compiling idmclib from sources, other dependencies are involved.
Read idmclib compiling instructions for an up-to-date reference.

To compile under Linux using the included build.xml unpack all the packages 
in a same directory.
Compile the idmclib library by typing:
$ cd idmclib-x.x.x-Source
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ..
$ make
For more details, read idmclib compiling instructions, or ask 
in mailing list and/or package mantainers.
When idmclib is compiled, go to the iDmc folder:
$ cd ../../iDmc

Finally, use ant to compile all:
$ ant dist-linux

Look for other ant targets in the build.xml file.
In principle, the same steps works also under Windows, using the MinGW/MSYS 
environment for compiling idmclib. Read idmclib documentation for further hints
about that. Anyway, the project mantainer will generally take care of distributing
precompiled windows binaries.

In the misc directory you will also find a NSIS (Nullsoft Scriptable
Install System, http://nsis.sourceforge.net/home/) script to create
Windows autoinstaller packages.
