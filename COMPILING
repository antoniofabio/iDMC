HOW TO COMPILE dmcDue/iDmc
--------------------------

Starting from the 2.x.x series, iDmc is a pure Java program
(although it depends on the native idmclib library).

iDmc was developed under Debian and Ubuntu GNU/Linux mainly using the 
IBM Eclipse IDE (www.eclipse.org) and Netbeans.

The Java part is Java2 1.6 compliant.

Full and successful compile and runtime testing was done with Sun's Java2 
SDK/JRE 1.5.0_08 under Ubuntu GNU/Linux (x86_64/x86_32) and under Micro$oft Windows XP.

The compilation defaults to produce a "static" jar file. This is to avoid dependencies hells only and is not stricly
required.

Sofware you need to compile:

- Java2 SDK 1.6 or above
  java.sun.com/j2se/

- Apace ant 1.5 or above
  http://ant.apache.org/

Third part libraries:

- idmclib: The iDMC C support library, version 0.8.x
  http://code.google.com/p/idmclib

- JGoodies Forms, Java panels layout library
  http://www.jgoodies.com/

- JFree JFreeChart 0.9.18: a free Java class library for generating charts
  www.jfree.org

- JCommon 0.9.3: used by JFreeChart
  www.jfree.org

- jakarta-log4j-1.2.14: logging library used by JFreeChart
  http://logging.apache.org/log4j/docs

The JGoodies Forms library API is stable so, generally
speaking, you should be able to use more recent versions of this
library. About JFreeChart, the core library of the program, stick to
the specified version or you'll certainly have to adapt part of the
code.
For compiling idmclib from sources, other dependencies are involved.
Read idmclib compiling instructions for an up-to-date reference.

----------------------------
LINUX BUILDING INSTRUCTIONS
----------------------------
Follows step-by-step compiling instructions of iDMC + idmclib
for linux systems.

= Required software =
Before starting, you need to install the following software:
  * JDK 6
  * SWIG 1.3.31
  * Ant 1.6.5
  * GCC (3.4 or 4.x): gcc
  * GNU make
  * CMake-2.4.6

You will also need the following libraries:
  * lua 5.0
  * gsl 1.9

On Ubuntu Feisty, you can type:

# sudo apt-get install gcc make cmake swig ant sun-java6-jdk gsl-dev liblua50-dev liblualib50-dev libgsl0-dev

and you're ok. Similar package names should work on other Debian-based distributions. For other linux distributions, read your distro documentation for how to install the above software.

= The building toolset =
Download all the required source packages from the web and unpack them 
all in a same folder with the commands:

##COPY&PASTE FROM HERE...
wget http://idmc.googlecode.com/files/iDMC_building_toolset.tar.bz2
tar xjf iDMC_building_toolset.tar.bz2
cd iDMC_building_toolset
wget http://idmclib.googlecode.com/files/idmclib-0.9.0-Source.tar.gz
tar xzf idmclib-0.9.0-Source.tar.gz
wget http://idmc.googlecode.com/files/iDmc-2.0.11-src.tar.bz2
tar xjf iDmc-2.0.11-src.tar.bz2
##TO HERE.

(replace 2.0.10 with your version of iDMC)

= Compiling the native library =
Enter the `iDMC_building_toolset\idmclib-0.9.0-Source` folder, and type:
# mkdir build
# cd build
# cmake ..

If all goes right, you can now compile with:
# make

= Compiling the java part =
If you passed the previous section, you're almost ok.
Enter the `iDMC_building_toolset/iDmc-2.x.x` folder and type:
# ant dist-linux

This will create the `dist` subfolder containing the full iDMC distribution.

In case of troubles, ask project mantainers and/or in mailing list.

= Installing =
Copy the `iDMC_building_toolset/iDmc-2.x.x/dist` folder in a location of your 
choice. For example, copy it in your home directory by typing:
# cp -r dist ~/iDMC

= Running =
Run iDMC by:
# cd ~/iDMC
# java -jar iDmc-2.x.x.jar

------------------------------
WINDOWS BUILDING INSTRUCTIONS
------------------------------
In principle, the same steps works also under Windows, using the MinGW/MSYS 
environment for compiling idmclib and issuing 'ant dist' for actual iDMC 
building. 
Read idmclib documentation for further hints about that.
Anyway, the project mantainer will generally take care of distributing
precompiled windows binaries.

In the misc directory you will also find a no longer maintaned NSIS (Nullsoft Scriptable Install System, http://nsis.sourceforge.net/home/) script to create Windows autoinstaller packages.

-----------------------
Building the installer
-----------------------
In the installer directory you will find support files for generating the win/linux IzPack installer. You can generate it under linux, taking care of placing the windows native DLL in the iDmc root directory.
