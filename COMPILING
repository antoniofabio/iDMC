HOW TO COMPILE dmcDue/iDmc
--------------------------

Starting from the 2.x.x series, iDmc is a pure Java program
(although it depends on the native idmclib library).

iDmc was developed under Debian and Ubuntu GNU/Linux mainly using the IBM Eclipse
IDE (www.eclipse.org) and Netbeans.

The Java part is Java2 1.6 compliant.

Full and successful compile and runtime testing was done with Sun's Java2 
SDK/JRE 1.5.0_08 under Ubuntu GNU/Linux (x86_64/x86_32) and under Micro$oft Windows XP.

The compilation defaults to produce a "static" jar file. This is to avoid dependencies hells only and is not stricly
required.

Sofware you need to compile:

- Java2 SDK 1.6 or above
  java.sun.com/j2se/

- Apace ant 1.5 or above
  http://ant.apache.org/

Third part libraries:

- idmclib: The iDMC C support library, version 0.7.x
  http://code.google.com/p/idmclib

- JGoodies Forms, Java panels layout library
  http://www.jgoodies.com/

- JFree JFreeChart 0.9.18: a free Java class library for generating charts
  www.jfree.org

- JCommon 0.9.3: used by JFreeChart
  www.jfree.org

- jakarta-log4j-1.2.14: logging library used by JFreeChart
  http://logging.apache.org/log4j/docs

The JGoodies Forms library API is stable so, generally
speaking, you should be able to use more recent versions of this
library. About JFreeChart, the core library of the program, stick to
the specified version or you'll certainly have to adapt part of the
code.
For compiling idmclib from sources, other dependencies are involved.
Read idmclib compiling instructions for an up-to-date reference.

To compile under Linux using the included build.xml unpack all the packages 
in a same directory. Compile the idmclib library by following boundled compiling istructions.
For more details, or in case of troubles, try ask 
in mailing list and/or package mantainers.
When idmclib is compiled, go to the iDmc folder:
$ cd ../../iDmc-2.x.x

Finally, use ant to compile all:
$ ant dist-linux

Look for other ant targets in the build.xml file.
In principle, the same steps works also under Windows, using the MinGW/MSYS 
environment for compiling idmclib and issuing 'ant dist' for actual iDMC building. 
Read idmclib documentation for further hints about that. 
Anyway, the project mantainer will generally take care of distributing
precompiled windows binaries.

In the misc directory you will also find a no longer maintaned NSIS (Nullsoft Scriptable
Install System, http://nsis.sourceforge.net/home/) script to create
Windows autoinstaller packages.
In the installer directory you will find support files for generating the win/linux 
IzPack installer. You can generate it under linux, taking care to place the windows native DLL
in the iDmc root directory.
