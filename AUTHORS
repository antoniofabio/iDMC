version 1.9.0: some of the program functionality was enhanced 
by Alexei Grigoriev <alexei_grigoriev@libero.it>, based
on iDMC-0.17.4, and bug fixes in iDMC-0.17.6, both by Daniele Pizzoni.
When the phrase "extended by A. G." appears in a 
source file, it means that this file might have been, but
not necessarily was, modified from its iDMC-0.17.4 or iDMC-0.17.6
version.

version 1.9.4: bug-fixes and some additions by Antonio, Fabio Di Narzo.
