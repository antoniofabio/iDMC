- Why there are so many references to the name "dmcDue"?

Because the name dmcDue was chosen by the author and used during the
developement of the program. The name was changed later by the
copyright holders. You can think "dmcDue" as the internal code name of
the program. "Due" is the italian for "two". dmcDue is a rewrite of an
old program called "dmc".
