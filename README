1. iDmc -  Dynamical Model Calculator
=======================================

This is iDMC the interactive Dynamical Model Calculator simulates and
performs graphical and numerical analysis of systems of differential
and difference equations.

iDmc is Copyright (C) 2004-2007 Marji Lines and Alfredo Medio.

iDmc was designed and written by Daniele Pizzoni <auouo@tin.it>, and 
subsequently modified by A. Grigoriev and A. F. Di Narzo.

iDmc was developed within a research project financed by the Italian
Ministry of Universities, the Universities of Udine and Ca'Foscari of
Venice, the Friuli-Venezia Giulia Region.

============================
2. What's new in this 2.x.x
============================
In this version there are some new features w.r.t. version 1.9.3.

* Data exporting
- ability to export trajectory, Lyapunov exponents and basins of attraction data
to external files, ready to be opened with the software of your choice

* Basins of attraction
- added a new faster algorithm for basins of attractions
- added full colors customization in basin of attraction plots, with possibility
  of saving settings between one session and another

* Random numbers
- added many new random distributions
- added a whole new random number generator with good statistical properties
- added possibility of setting RNG seed for reproducibility of results

* Periodic cycles
- added cycles classification based on stability
- improved input mask

* Error messages
- more detailed syntax and runtime LUA error messages reporting

* Bug fixes
- misc problems in Lyapunov exponent plots with diverging exponents

* Invisible to user
- removed C code from the software. Now iDMC (i.e., GUI and plotting)
  is written entirely in Java, while using a separate specialized library, 
  idmclib, for actual numerical analysis
- upgraded external libraries to more recent versions
